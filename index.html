					<p>
						I'm a software engineer with a passion for programming. In 2016, as a sophomore in college, I decided to drop my
						business analytics major and pursue a degree in computer science — I couldn't be happier with my decision!
            I've come a long way since then, from autonomously piloting EA-18 Growlers in formation to empowering
            the daily delivery of millions of communications to Square sellers. I'm excited to continue building software
            that makes a meaningful impact.

						<h2>What is Cardano?</h2>
						<p>
							Cardano is a blockchain platform for "changemakers, innovators, and visionaries" designed to bring positive change to the world.
							It operates on a proof-of-stake protocol, Ouroboros, that offers improved security guarantees and lower energy costs when compared to proof-of-work protocols.
						</p>
						<h2>What is a stake pool?</h2>
						<p>
							Owners of ADA (Cardano's native currency) have a stake in the network proportional to their holding size.
							ADA holders can earn rewards by delegating their stake to a stake pool.
							The more ADA delegated to a given stake pool, the higher the pool's chance to mint the next block for the blockchain.
							The stake pool operators and their delegators share the rewards earned by adding blocks.
						</p>
						<h2>What was Vulcan's mission?</h2>
						<p>
							Our mission was to empower Cardano as an emerging technology by operating as a node in the network, engaging with the vibrant community,
              and supporting decentralized finance (DeFi) applications built on the protocol.

						<p><strong>Course: </strong>Capstone Project</p>
						<p><strong>Objective: </strong>Our objective was to create a fun, educational application for
							investing in the stock market. Stock Overflow had two main features: an educational
							mode where users could practice investing in stocks with real-time prices, and a competitive
							fantasy stock trading league where users could compete against their friends to see who can
							make the highest gain over a set period of time. All of the money and purchases were
							fictional of course, but we simulated real-life investing as close as possible given
							our API limitations.</p>
						<p><strong>Technologies: </strong>This was a four person project that we developed over
							the course of thirteen scrum sprints. We managed our sprints with Confluence and JIRA,
							and utilized a Git repository hosted in BitBucket. The application was written in Java
							using both the Spring and Hibernate frameworks. The frontend was built with JavaServlet
							Pages (JSP), and data was stored in a MySQL database.</p>

						<p><strong>Course: </strong>Advanced Web Application Development</p>
						<p><strong>Objective/Outcome: </strong>I sought to design a social media based gift giving
							platform. The idea was that users could add items to a list of gifts they're interested in,
							then their friends could "claim" gifts to buy for them for the holidays. The application
							would resemble a wedding registry, but wouldn't be limited to the wedding space. I completed
							the project on my own, met all my desired requirements, and I'm happy with the result.</p>
						<p><strong>Technologies: </strong>I completed this project individually using Subversion and an
							SVN repository for version control. The frontend html pages were built with JavaServlet
							Pages (JSP) and CSS styling was done with the Materialize framework. The server side code is
							written in Java with the spring framework and data is stored is a MySQL relational database
							hosted on Google App Engine (of course, the dev database was local to my machine). I used
							Maven for build automation and I successfully deployed the application to Google App Engine.

							homepage would be filled with content from the users they follow and other posts on topics
							that are similar to their interests. Users could attach images to their posts or update
							their profile picture with custom images from their PC. We successfully presented an Alpha
							version of the site with the above functionalities.</p>
						<p><strong>Technologies: </strong>I completed this project in a group of four. We developed the
							application with agile methods over the course of three scrum sprints. We managed our

							server side code for the project was written in Java using the Spring framework, the
							frontend html pages were built with JaveServlet Pages (JSP), and the database was stored in
							MySQL and accessed with basic connection pooling and SQL statements.</p>

				I've loved team sports my entire life. Though I tried almost all of them, lacrosse and hockey were my two favorites growing up.
				I was blessed with the opportunity to continue my lacrosse career at the NCAA Division III level at Benedictine University.
				The friendships I made through the BenU teams are irreplaceable and have continued despite graduation and thousands of miles of separation.
				Off the turf, my pride and joy was winning the BenU intramural badminton competition with my teammate, Blake.
				After moving to St. Louis, I continued to play lacrosse and hockey in men's leagues, including a skate organized by Boeing employees.
				Additionally, golf became more prominent in my life as well. I was able to help my team win back-to-back Boeing Golf League
        Championships in 2019 and 2020. Since moving to Utah, I joined the Salt Lake Storm — a semi-professional box lacrosse team in the Box
        Lacrosse League. It's been fun to compete at a higher level than recreational leagues can provide.

        I enjoy a wide range of outdoor activities, and I'm not afraid of a good ole-fashioned sufferfest. I completed the American Mountaineering and
        Technical Leadership (AMTL) I certification through the American Alpine Institute and have gone on to make unguided ascents of Mt. Rainier,
        Eldorado Peak, Mt. Olympus, and Mt. Shuksan. I enjoy climbing moderate multi-pitch alpine rock, though I've only ever followed on trad gear.
        This summer, I'm hoping to expand into leading and tackle some granite classics in the Wasatch. Backcountry skiing is my favorite outdoor activity
        and consumes my life from November to April. There are few feelings that compare to floating through untracked, bottomless powder.
      </p>
      <p>
        Backpacking with my wife and friends is also a favorite pastime. I love finding the perfect campsite and relaxing after a tough day's hike with a
        heavy pack. We try to plan several trips throughout the year to explore a variety of landscapes in optimal conditions — desert adventures in the
        spring, and mountain rambles in the fall. Last year, we spent time in Canyonlands and the Sawtooth Mountains.
      </p>
      <p>
        I first learned about overlanding in 2016 through X Overland. In 2022, I purchased the most optimal overland vehicle imaginable — a 2-door Jeep Wrangler.
        It's been fun working around the limited space of the 2-door and building out the truck for both off-road performance and campsite luxury. The Jeep has
        seen plenty of off-road abuse, most notably extensive miles of rugged trail in the Maze District of Canyonlands and the surrounding Utah desert. I
        also got it stuck in two feet of mud in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan — that was the adventure that convinced me to purchase a winch and learn
        how to use it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I earned my Wilderness First Responder (WFR) certification in 2024 and recently applied to join Salt Lake County Search & Rescue. I hope to leverage my
        technical skills and uphill conditioning to make a meaningful contribution to the team while helping recreationalists in need.
