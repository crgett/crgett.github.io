					<h1>Who is this guy?</h1>
					<p>
						I'm a software engineer with a passion for programming. In 2016, as a sophmore in college, I decided to drop my
						business analytics major and pursue a degree in computer science. I couldn't be happier with my
						decision! I've come a long way since then, from autonomously piloting EA-18 Growlers in formation to
						creating a software startup and Cardano stake pool. I'm excited to see the positive impact I can have
						through the software products I build.

					Eating a well-rounded diet is key to leading a long, healthy life and the internet is chock-full of delicious recipes to satisfy anyone's palette.
					That being said, I don't need to read about the history of salmon before I learn how to prepare a fillet and I don't want to sign up for a mailing list.
					Traditional recipe sharing websites are cluttered with content that users simply don't care about and it ruins the experience.

					Get Cooking is seeking to change the way people find and share recipes online by offering a clean, minimalistic user-interface with no blogs or excessive advertising.
					You are able to store your own recipes and keep a list of your favorites from other users.
					If you're looking for something specific, you can easily filter through a variety of tags or search by ingredient.
					If you aren't sure what to make, you can flip through the randomizer and see what catches your eye.

						<h2>What is Cardano?</h2>
						<p>
							Cardano is a blockchain platform for "changemakers, innovators, and visionaries" designed to bring positive change to the world.
							It operates on a proof-of-stake protocol, Ouroboros, that offers improved security guarantees and lower energy costs when compared to proof-of-work protocols.
						</p>
						<h2>What is a stake pool?</h2>
						<p>
							Owners of ADA (Cardano's native currency) have a stake in the network proportional to their holding size.
							ADA holders can earn rewards by delegating their stake to a stake pool.
							The more ADA delegated to a given stake pool, the higher the pool's chance to mint the next block for the blockchain.
							The stake pool operators and their delegators share the rewards earned by adding blocks.
						</p>
						<h2>What is Vulcan's mission?</h2>
						<p>
							Our mission is to empower Cardano as an emerging technology by operating as a node in the network, engaging with the vibrant community, and supporting decentralized finance (DeFi) applications built on the protocol.
							Currently, 25 ADA per epoch that Vulcan successfully mints a block will be pooled to create "The Vulcan Fund". This fund will strictly be used to support DeFi on the Cardano network through peer-to-peer lending.

						<p><strong>Course: </strong>Capstone Project</p>
						<p><strong>Objective: </strong>Our objective is to create a fun, educational application for
							investing in the stock market. Stock Overflow will have two main features: an educational
							mode where users can practice investing in stocks with real-time prices and a competitive
							fantasy stock trading league where users can compete against their friends to see who can
							make the highest gain over a set period of time. All of the money and purchases are
							fictional of course, but will be simulating real-life investing as close as possible given
							our API limitations.</p>
						<p><strong>Technologies: </strong>This is a four person project that we'll be developing over
							the course of thirteen scrum sprints. We will manage our sprints with Confluence and JIRA,
							and utilize a Git repository hosted in BitBucket. The application will be written in Java
							using both the Spring and Hibernate frameworks. The frontend will be built with JavaServlet
							Pages (JSP), and data will be stored in a MySQL database.</p>

						<p><strong>Course: </strong>Advanced Web Application Development</p>
						<p><strong>Objective/Outcome: </strong>I sought to design a social media based gift giving
							platform. The idea is that users can add items to a list of gifts they're interested in,
							then their friends could "claim" gifts to buy for them for the holidays. The application
							would resemble a wedding registry, but wouldn't be limited to the wedding space. I completed
							the project on my own and, although the homepage is rough, I met all my desired requirements
							and am happy with the result.</p>
						<p><strong>Technologies: </strong>I completed this project individually using Subversion and an
							SVN repository for version control. The frontend html pages were built with JavaServlet
							Pages (JSP) and CSS styling was done with the Materialize framework. The server side code is
							written in Java with the spring framework and data is stored is a MySQL relational database
							hosted on Google App Engine (of course, the dev database was local to my machine). I used
							Maven for build automation and I successfully deployed the application to Google App Engine.

						<p><strong>Course: </strong>Software Engineering</p>
						<p><strong>Objective/Outcome: </strong>Our objective was to create a social media platform /
							Pinterest knockoff that allowed users to create posts on topics that interest them, follow
							other users, like/comment on other users' posts, and search for posts or users. Their
							homepage would be filled with content from the users they follow and other posts on topics
							that are similar to their interests. Users could attach images to their posts or update
							their profile picture with custom images from their PC. We successfully presented an Alpha
							version of the site with the above functionalities.</p>
						<p><strong>Technologies: </strong>I completed this project in a group of four. We developed the
							application with agile methods over the course of three scrum sprints. We managed our
							sprints with Confluence and JIRA, and we utilized a Git repository hosted in BitBucket. The
							server side code for the project was written in Java using the Spring framework, the
							frontend html pages were built with JaveServlet Pages (JSP), and the database was stored in
							MySQL and accessed with basic connection pooling and SQL statements.</p>

				I've loved team sports my entire life. Though I tried almost all of them, lacrosse and hockey were my two favorites growing up.
				I was blessed with the opportunity to continue my lacrosse career at the NCAA Division III level at Benedictine University.
				The friendships I made through the BenU teams are irreplaceable and have continued despite graduation and thousands of miles of separation.
				Off the turf, my pride and joy was winning the BenU intramural badminton competition with my teammate, Blake.
				Since moving to St. Louis, I've continued to play lacrosse and hockey in men's leagues, including a skate organized by Boeing employees.
				Golf has become more prominent in my life as well, and I was able to help my team win back-to-back Boeing Golf League Championships in 2019 and 2020.
