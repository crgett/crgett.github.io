			<h1>Who is this guy?</h1>

			<p>I'm an aspiring software engineer with a passion for programming. Two years ago, I decided to drop my business analytics major and pursue a degree in computer science; I couldn't be happier with my decision! I've come a long way since then, from autonomously piloting an AR Drone with node.js to deploying a full-stack Java Spring application to Google App Engine, and I'm excited to see what the future has in store.</p>

			<h1>Beyond the Code</h1>

				<div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6 tab">
					<i class="fa fa-plane fa-5x"></i>
					<p>I've lived in six different states and have visited most of the continental US. A good friend of mine lives in Scotland, so I've been able to travel through parts of Europe with him. Isle of Skye is by far the coolest place I've ever visited.</p>

					<i class="fab fa-d-and-d fa-5x"></i>
					<p>I'm a huge geek when it comes to medieval themed movies, shows, games, and events. I go to the Renessaince Faire every year and I'm obsessed with Game of Thrones. I've played World of Warcraft for 10 years, and I don't plan on stopping anytime soon.</p>

					<p>Although I wouldn't call myself a thrill seeker, I have many hobbies and interests that make my mom nervous; These include motorcycles, skiing, snowboarding, rock climbing, archery, knife/axe throwing, competitive team sports, and video games.</p>

			<h1>Academics</h1>

			<p>As a senior at Benedictine University, I believe my formal education, and my own personal studies, have prepared me to hit the ground running in industry. I have honed my communication skills and successfully completed multiple group projects using development tools and frameworks such as Scrum, Git, BitBucket, Confluence, and JIRA. At Benedictine, our foundation of data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented principles is built with Java, so I consider this my most comprehensive language. However, I've been exposed to a variety of other languages including JavaScript, SQL, and Python.</p>

							<p><strong>Course: </strong>Capstone Project</p>
							<p><strong>Objective: </strong>Our of objectives is to create an fun, educational application for investing in the stock market. Stock Overflow will have two main features: an educational mode where users can practice investing in stocks with real-time prices and a competitive fantasy stock trading league where users can compete against their friends to see who can make the highest gain over a set period of time. All of the money and purchases are fictional of course, but will be simulating real-life investing as close as is possible with our API limitations.</p>
							<p><strong>Technologies: </strong>This is a four person project that we'll be developing over the course of thirteen scrum sprints. We will manage our sprints with Confluence and JIRA, and utilized a Git repository hosted in BitBucket. The application will be written in Java using both the Spring and Hibernate frameworks. The frontend will be built with JavaServlet Pages (JSP), and data will be stored in a MySQL database.</p>

							<p><strong>Course: </strong>Software Engineering</p>
							<p><strong>Objective/Outcome: </strong>Our of objectives was to create a social media platform / Pinterest knockoff that allowed users to create posts on topics that interest them, follow other users, like/comment on other users posts, and search for posts or users. Their homepage would be filled with content from the users they follow and other posts on topics that are similar to their interests. Users could attach images to their posts or update their profile picture with custom images from their PC. We successfully presented an Alpha version of the site with the above functionalities.</p>
							<p><strong>Technologies: </strong>I completed this project in a group of four. We developed the application with agile methods over the course of three scrum sprints. We managed our sprints with Confluence and JIRA, and we utilized a Git repository hosted in BitBucket. The server side code for the project was written in Java using the Spring framework, the frontend html pages were built with JaveServlet Pages (JSP), and the database was stored in MySQL and accessed with basic connection pooling and SQL statements.</p>

							<p><strong>Course: </strong>Advanced Web Application Development</p>
							<p><strong>Objective/Outcome: </strong>I sought to design a social media based gift giving platform. The idea is that users can add items to a list of gifts their interested in, then their friends could "claim" gifts to buy for them for the holidays. The application would resemble a wedding registry, but wouldn't be limited to the wedding space. I completed the project on my own and, although the homepage is rough, I met all my desired requirements and am happy with the result.</p>
							<p><strong>Technologies: </strong>I completed this project individually using Subversion and an SVN repository for version control. The frontend html pages were built with JavaServlet Pages (JSP) and CSS styling was done with the Materialize framework. The server side code is written in Java with the spring framework and data is stored is a MySQL relational database hosted on Google App Engine (of course, the dev database was local to my machine). I used Maven for build automation and I successfully deployed the application to Google App Engine.</p>

							<p><strong>Course: </strong>Software Engineering</p>
							<p><strong>Objective/Outcome: </strong>Our of objectives was to create a small arcade using the JavaFX platform. At this point, I had experience using Java Swing to make a zombie apocalypse board game, but I'd never used JavaFX. My group and I decided to take on the challenge of learning JavaFX as we designed the arcade over two scrum sprints. We built three games: tic-tac-toe, minesweeper, and a fortune teller. </p>
							<p><strong>Technologies: </strong>I completed this project with two other students. We used Subversion and an SVN repository for version control. The arcade and game GUIs were built with JavaFX and all the backend logic was built in Java. This project was my first experience with Scrum contracts and agile development.</p>

							<p><strong>Course: </strong>Advanced Web Application Development</p>
							<p><strong>Objective/Outcome: </strong>Our firsts group project in advanced web was to create an e-commerce site; My group created a fictional website that sold hats. After the group project was complete, we - individually - had to make an adiminstrative platform for our e-commerce site. This platform needed to have complete CRUD operations for users, products, and purchases. Also, we needed to impliment batch uploads through a CSV file for users and products. An elegant UI wasn't required in the specification, but was recommended for ease-of-use.</p>
							<p><strong>Technologies: </strong>I completed this project prior to learning any Java web frameworks, such as Spring and Hibernate. So, I had to build out the application with basic Java Servlets - the old fashioned way. The frontend was designed using JavaServlet Pages (JSP) and data was stored in a MySQL relational database. We deployed our projects locally to an Apache Tomcat server.</p>

							<p><strong>Course: </strong>Natural Science Summer Research Program</p>
							<p><strong>Objective/Outcome: </strong>I worked on this research project with one other student and a professor from Benedictine. The focus of the project was to create a low-cost autonomous drone capable of detecting a reference object for search and resuce applications. By the end of the summer, the contribution of the work was a script capable of detecting a 3-dimensional reference object through post-processing of drone footage.</p>
							<p><strong>Technologies: </strong>Image processing was done with a Matlab script that detected, compared, and matched SURF in a cycle of images of a reference object and a single video frame. RANSAC and proportion comparisons were used to locate the reference object in the video frame and prevent misidentifying other objects. We piloted the drone with libaries written in either node.js or java.</p>

			<p>I've been playing team sports my entire life. Originally, I loved baseball, but that obsession faded away when I couldn't bat to save my life. When we moved to the east coast, I picked up a new sport called lacrosse; It was the perfect sport for me. Hockey was the only other sport I continued to play into high school, and I'm so glad I never gave it up. I was blessed with the opportunity to continue my lacrosse career at the NCAA Division III level at Benedictine University. The friendships I've made through this team are irreplaceable and I expect they'll continue long after we graduate. When I'm not on the turf, I still like to compete; My pride and joy is winning the intramural badminton competition with my teammate, Blake.</p>
